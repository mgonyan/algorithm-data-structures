Algorithm and Data Structures 
=============================

The goal of this repository is allow me to:

1. Refresh all the data structures and algorithms concepts I have learnt when I was at the university, which I consider really important and useful tool when you face a programing problem.

2. Keep my skills sharp.

3. Import is algorithm analysis then I will provide the complexity of every algorithm using the worst
  case or Big O() notation.

4. Try different programing languages

The exercises are based on the following book:
- [Introduction to Algorithms 3rd edition](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Introduction-Algorithms-T-Cormen/dp/0262533057)

## Programing languages:

- Javascript: 
- PHP:


## Collaboration

Any suggestion is welcome through GitHub issues
